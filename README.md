Dynamic Data Processing

Overview

Dynamic Data Processing is a comprehensive project designed to implement various algorithms and data structures for efficient data analysis and manipulation. This project includes functionalities for calculating running means, generating recursive patterns, sorting linked lists, and managing dynamic memory effectively. It emphasizes robust input validation and user-friendly error handling.

Features

Running Mean Calculation: Computes the running mean of a series of measurements, ensuring accurate analysis of data trends.
Recursive Pattern Generation: Utilizes recursion to generate intricate numerical patterns based on user-defined input, showcasing the power of recursive algorithms.
Linked List Sorting: Implements both insertion and selection sort algorithms to organize unsorted linked lists in descending order, highlighting efficient sorting techniques.
Dynamic Memory Management: Ensures optimal use of memory with dynamic allocation and deallocation, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers.
Usage

Running Mean: Users can input a file containing measurements, and the program calculates the running mean, providing results formatted for clarity.
Pattern Generation: The program prompts users for the number of rows to generate a visually appealing numerical pattern.
Linked List Operations: Users can interact with linked lists, applying sorting algorithms to manage data efficiently.
Error Handling

The project incorporates comprehensive error handling, including:

File access verification
Input validation for numerical values
Memory allocation checks
In case of errors, informative messages are provided to guide users toward resolution.

Requirements

C/C++ compiler
Standard libraries for I/O and memory management
Conclusion

Dynamic Data Processing serves as a practical tool for data analysis and algorithmic exploration, demonstrating effective coding practices, algorithm design, and dynamic memory management.
